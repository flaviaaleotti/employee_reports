# EMPLOYEES/REPORT DATABASE MANAGEMENT

This is a REST API written in Python to manage a database of employees and related reports
The app is ment to run locally with local databases that can easily be created via some Python scripts (see instruction below)

Requirements:
- Python 3.6 or + 
- Python modules: flask, sqlite3, requests, uuid, subprocess
- pytest for testing the app

any missing python module as well as pytest can be easily be installed with pip (e.g: pip install flask). Make sure you are using pip3 version.

The following setup instructions (as well as the launch of the Python API) are meant to be performed from a terminal.
After the app is launched and running, its functionalities can be accessed via browser (see instructions below) or via terminal (e.g. curl)

## SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

Download the repository from github:

git clone https://github.com/flaviaaleotti/employee_reports.git

and enter the employee_reports/ directory
Inside the repository, you will find two python scripts that will automatically generate two basic default SQL databases (for employees and related reports)
Genarate the employees.db and reports.db databases by running

python3 build_employees_database.py
python3 build_report_database.py

from terminal inside the employee_reports/ directory
The pre-generated databases employees.db and reports.db are already available in teh repository, but you can run the above scripts to reset the database to the starting records at anytime in the future.

Now you are ready to start the API! run from terminal

python3 RESTAPI.py

## TESTING

Before using the API through your browser, you can test it with pytest in order to assess all endpoints.
To run the tests, open another terminal (leave the API running, otherwise all tests will fail), go to the employee_reports/ directory and simply type

pytest

you can also run the above pytest command  with -v option to increase verbosity if you want to check each single endpoint test.
If all tests are successfully passed, you can open your browser and start using the API!
#### REMEMBER:  the API should be always kept running in order to use it, so make sure that you do not close the terminal where you have your 'python3  RESTAPI.py' command running :)

## USING THE API
This API is designed to help you interact with the employee.db and report.db databases. These are SQL databases, in which items are stored in tables. Each row in a table corresponds to an element (an employee or a recod in our case) and is called a record, while each column corresponds to a particular piece of information characterizing the specific record (e.g: name, surname, job tilte etc. in case of an emoloyee). The table columns are called fields.

### DATABASE DETAILS
SQL databases are conceptually simple and easy to interact with through Python flask module, that's why they were chosen for this API.

The employee items are characterized by the following fields:
- id : this is a unique identified (integer number) characterizing the employee
- first_name : first name of employee (string)
- last_name : last name of employee (string)
- username : employee username (string). The username is required to be unique.
- email: institutional email address of employee, characterized by the company.com domain (string)
- title : employee job title (string)
- department : company department (string)

In the default database, the username field is created by combining the firt letter of first name and the last name (e.g., employee Mario Rossi would have username mrossi), but this is not mandatory and you can crate new employees with whatever username (as long as the uniqueness is preserved).
In the default database, the department field is a capital single letter ('A', 'B', 'C'...), but any other string will be accepted upon creation of a new employee. The same holds for all other string fields (except username, see above).

The report items are characterized by the following fields:
- id : this is a unique identified (integer number) characterizing the report
- title : report title (string)
- description : report description (string)
- employee_username : username (string) of the employee related to the report.
- priority: report priority (string, either 'high' or 'low')

The employee_username field is the username of an existing employee, and the priority string can only assume 'high' or 'low' values (any other value will not be accepted)

For both employees and reports, the id identifier is automatically generated by te database whenever a new item is added. The id field is immutable and cannot be modified.

### HOME PAGE
To navigate and use the API functionalities with your browser, open a browser window and go to http://localhost:5000 

If the API is still running in your terminal (python3  RESTAPI.py, see before) you should see the homepage.

### FILTER REPORTS
By clicking on "Search report", you will be redirected to the 'Filter Reports' page, in which you can enter a username or priority (or both) and press "Search" to filter the existing reports.

### ADDING A NEW EMPLOYEE
From the home page, you can reach the 'Add Employee' page by clicking on the "Add new employee" button. In the Add Employee page, you cal fill all the table fields (all fields are required) and press "Add".

If you provided a valid username, the procedure should be successful, and the new employee will be added to emoployee.db database. Because each employee must have at least one report, the creation of a new employee is automatically creating also a new defaul item in the reports.db database (tilte: Firts report), linked to the username of the new employee.

### ADDING A NEW REPORT
From the home page, you can reach the 'Add Report' page by clicking on the "Add new report" button. In the Add Report page, you cal fill all the table fields (all fields are required) and press "Add".

If you provided a valid employee username, the procedure should be successful, and the new report will be added to report.db database. 

### DELETING AN EMPLOYEE
If an employee stops working for our company, we can delete its record from the employee.db database easily.
From the home page, click on the "Delete employee" button to reach the "Delete employee" page. Insert the username and predd "Delete". If the provided username exists, the employee will be deleted from employee.db database, and all its releted reports will also be deleted from reports.db database.

### DELETING A REPORT
From the home page, click on the "Delete report" button to reach the "Delete report" page. Insert the report id and predd "Delete". If the provided report id exists, the report will be deleted from report.db database.

## OTHER FUNCTIONALITIES
Employees and reports can also be updated. However, implementing the update method trough HTML pages has proved to be harder than expected an I was not able to implement it in the html interface.

However, you can still edit one or more fields of an employee/report through command line with curl. The only restrictions are:
- id (of report or employee) cannot be edited
- employee_username field of a report cannot be edited directly. In order to edit this field, you should edit the username field of the employee item, and in this way all its releted reports will be updated as well
- username of an employee can be edited, but it must remain unique

### UPDATING AN EMPLOYEE
In order to update an existing employee, wemust know its id (as it is the only immutable field).
One or more of the remaining fields can be edited at the same time with curl. Here is an example that you can run on the default database, to change the job title of employee 1 from "junior developer" to "senior developer", their last name to "Curltest" and their username to "fcurltest":

curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title": "senior developer", "last_name": "Curltest", "username": "fcurltest"}' http://127.0.0.1:5000/update/employees/1

the -X PUT option is needed to edit an item, the -H "Content-Type: application/json" tells curl that we will pass the update content as json format, and -d preceeds the actual data for the update request. The last part of the command contains the url for the update request, ending with the employee id (1 in our case).

If the update was successful, the message "Employee fields and related reports successfully updated" should be printed in your terminal.

### UPDATING A REPORT
Similar to what we have seen for employees, also reports can be updated (e.g., to change the priority from high to low or viceversa).
In order to update an existing report, wemust know its id (as it is the only immutable field).
One or more of the remaining fields (except for the employee_username) can be edited at the same time with curl. Here is an example that you can run on the default database, to change the priority of report 1 from "low to high" and its title to "Updated priority":

curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"priority": "high", "title": "Updated priority"}' http://127.0.0.1:5000/update/reports/1

the -X PUT option is needed to edit an item, the -H "Content-Type: application/json" tells curl that we will pass the update content as json format, and -d preceeds the actual data for the update request. The last part of the command contains the url for the update request, ending with the report id (1 in our case).

If the update was successful, the message "Report fields successfully updated" should be printed in your terminal.
